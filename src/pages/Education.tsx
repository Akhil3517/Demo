                <h3>Protein</h3>
                <p>Proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues, making enzymes and hormones, and supporting immune function. Good sources include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, and nuts.</p>
                <p><strong>Recommended daily intake:</strong> 0.8g per kg of body weight for average adults, more for athletes and active individuals.</p>

                <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
                <p>Carbs are your body's main energy source. Complex carbs from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables provide sustained energy and essential nutrients. Simple carbs from processed foods can cause blood sugar spikes.</p>
                <p><strong>Recommended daily intake:</strong> 45-65% of total daily calories, preferably from complex carbohydrates.</p>

                <p>Healthy fats are essential for brain health, hormone production, and nutrient absorption. Focus on unsaturated fats from sources like olive oil, avocados, nuts, and fatty fish, while limiting saturated and trans fats.</p>
                <p><strong>Recommended daily intake:</strong> 20-35% of total daily calories, emphasizing unsaturated fats.</p>
